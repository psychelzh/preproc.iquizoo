#' Calculate basic speed and accuracy scores
#'
#' This function calculates reaction time and accuracy scores, which are very
#' basic to most tests.
#'
#' A major part of behavior tests is the speed and accuracy metrics, which are
#' actually the only ones that any test collects. Based on these two metrics,
#' two basic groups of scores can be obtained. The first group contains the mean
#' and standard deviations of response times the number, and the second contains
#' the number and percent of correct responses.
#'
#' @section Note:
#'
#'   Outlier removal is recommended and it is set as default in here. The
#'   outlier detection method used here is the "*interquantile range*" rule
#'   suggested by Tukey (1977).
#'
#' @templateVar by low
#' @templateVar name_acc TRUE
#' @templateVar name_rt TRUE
#' @template params-template
#' @param rm.out A logical value. Whether remove outlier or not. Default to
#'   `TRUE.`
#' @param rt_rtn If mean or standard deviation of response times should be
#'   returned.
#' @param acc_rtn If count or percent of correct responses should be returned.
#' @return A [tibble][tibble::tibble-package] contains the required scores.
