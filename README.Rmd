The goal of preproc.iquizoo is to provide pre-processing functions for IQUIZOO original data.

## Background

IQUIZOO is now a developing company shipped with a bunch of games assessing psychological constructs. The original data from these games have various formats, and this package tries to provide data preprocessing APIs for them.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("psychelzh/preproc.iquizoo")
```

## Usage

This package is best used in company with [tarflow.iquizoo](https://github.com/psychelzh/tarflow.iquizoo) package. Read the [documentation](https://psychelzh.github.io/tarflow.iquizoo) there.

## Advanced

To deal with the various formats of datasets, some custom configurations are supported. There will be two basic configurations used:

* `game_info`: provides information of each game and its pre-processing function name, so that one can easily match the correct function to preprocess data for these games based on this dataset. Now lives in [data.iquizoo package](https://github.com/psychelzh/data.iquizoo).
* `config_prep_fun`: provides configurations for each pre-processing functions, because each lower-level pre-processing functions will need pre-configured input and (optional) output variable names. Now also lives in [data.iquizoo package](https://github.com/psychelzh/data.iquizoo). But this configuration can be partly customized with a json file. An example is just as follows:

``` json
{
    "bart": {
        "input": {
            "name_nhit": "nhit",
            "name_feedback": "feedback"
        },
        "output": [
            "mean_pumps",
            "mean_pumps_raw"
        ]
    }
}
```
