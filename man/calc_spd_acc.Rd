calc_spd_acc(
  data,
  name_acc,

  rt_rm_out = TRUE,

\arguments{
\item{data}{Raw data of class \code{data.frame}.}

\item{name_acc}{The column name of the \code{data} input whose values are user's correctness, in which is a \code{numeric} vector so coded that 1 means scoring correct, 0 means scoring incorrect, and that -1 means no response is made.}

\item{name_rt}{The column name of the \code{data} input whose values are user's reaction time, in which is a \code{numeric} vector with \code{NA} values representing abnormal reaction times.}

\item{rt_rm_out}{A logical value. Whether remove response time outlier or
not. Default to \code{TRUE.}}

\item{rt_unit}{The unit of response time in \code{data}.}

\item{rt_rtn}{If mean or standard deviation of response times should be
returned.}

\item{acc_rtn}{If count or percent of correct responses should be returned.}

\item{sat_rtn}{If any of the speed-accuracy trade-off index should be
returned. \code{"IES"}, \code{"RCS"} and \code{"LISAS"} are supported.}
}
\value{
A \link[tibble:tibble-package]{tibble} contains the required scores.
}
\description{
This function calculates reaction time and accuracy scores, which are very
basic to most tests.
}
\details{
A major part of behavior tests is the speed and accuracy metrics, which are
actually the only ones that any test collects. Based on these two metrics,
two basic groups of scores can be obtained. The first group contains the mean
and standard deviations of response times the number, and the second contains
the number and percent of correct responses.

\section{Note}{


Outlier removal is recommended and it is set as default in here. The
outlier detection method used here is the one recommended by Cousineau, D.,
& Chartier, S. (2010).
