cpt(data, by, vars_input)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Raw data of class \code{data.frame}.}

\item{by}{The column name(s) in \code{data} used to be grouped by.}

Continuous Performance Test (CPT) is a classical test for attention. There
are many methods used to calculate the performance index of this task, and
here only includes those common ones.
